  <h3 class="subtitle">Description</h3>
  <p class="description">A delicious take on a classic dish. A bit crispier than you might be used to.</p>
  <h3 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h3>
  <ul class="ingredients">
    <li class="item">4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li class="item">salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li class="item">2 eggs</li>
    <li class="item">1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
    <li class="item">1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li class="item">2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
    <li class="item">1 cup olive oil for frying</li>
    <li class="item">1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
    <li class="item">1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
    <li class="item">1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    <li class="item">1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
    <li class="item">1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li class="item">1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="subtitle">Steps</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li class="item">Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
    <li class="item">Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li class="item">Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li class="item">Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
    <li class="item">Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
    <li class="item">Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li class="item">Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
    <li class="item">Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
    <li class="item">Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
